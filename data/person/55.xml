Selective Service Lottery. For dob 1953 I was in the #353 position Sept 14.&lt;/br&gt;
Draft lotteries were conducted again in 1971 (for those born in 1952) and 1972 to 1976 (for 1953 to 1956 births). The draft numbers issued in 1972 were never used to call for induction into service, because the last call was December 7 and authority to induct expired June 30, 1973.</note></event><event><type>Graduation</type><date>Jul 1972</date><place>Milpitas, Santa Clara California, USA</place></event><event><type>Residence</type><date>from 1973 to 1979</date><place>US Navy</place></event><event><type>Military Service</type><date>from Oct 1973 to Jun 1979</date><place>US Navy</place></event><event><type>Residence</type><date>from 1979 to 1980</date><place>Bellevue, King, Washington, USA</place></event><event><type>Residence</type><date>from 1980 to 1983</date><place>Seattle King, Washington</place></event><event><type>Residence</type><date>from 1983 to 2004</date><place>Seattle King, Washington</place></event><event><type>Graduation</type><date>Dec 1983</date></event><event><type>Residence</type><date>from 2004 to 2020</date><place>6226 30th Ave NE Seattle WA 98115 USA</place></event><event><type>Reference No</type><place>28 NOV 2016 16:21:49</place></event><parents id="14" rel="birth parents"><father>61</father><mother>15</mother><sibling id="53"/><sibling id="48"/></parents></person>
